                    <h1>WELCOME TO FLORENCE</h1>
                    <p>Florence is the capital city of the Italian
                        region of Tuscany. It is also the most populated city in Tuscany, with 360,930 inhabitants in
                        2023, and
                        984,991 in its metropolitan area. Florence was a centre of medieval European trade and finance
                        and
                        one of the wealthiest cities of that era. It is considered by many academics to have been the
                        birthplace of the Renaissance, becoming a major artistic, cultural, commercial, political,
                        economic and
                        financial center. During this time, Florence rose to a position of enormous influence in Italy,
                        Europe, and beyond. Its turbulent political history includes periods of rule by the powerful
                        Medici
                        family and numerous religious and republican revolutions. From 1865 to 1871 the city served as
                        the
                        capital of the Kingdom of Italy. The Florentine dialect forms the base of standard Italian and
                        it became
                        the language of culture throughout Italy due to the prestige of the masterpieces by Dante
                        Alighieri,
                        Petrarch, Giovanni Boccaccio, Niccol√≤ Machiavelli and Francesco Guicciardini.</p>
